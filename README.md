# Australia_Influenza_Analysis_Showcase
Code and materials for a 2-day individual data analytics test I took in 2021

A public Australian influenza dataset was provided in the test. I was asked to provide any insights found
from the datatset and predict future influenza cases with any method. After the analysis, I was also asked
to do a presentation on the methodology and findings. The test was completed individually within two days.

In this repo, I have saved the python code (in jupyter) and the presentation slides as a showcase. The raw
data I used were not attached but can be found on the Department of Health website and ABS.

Thanks for reading!
